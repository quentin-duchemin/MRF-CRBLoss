    "================\n",

    "We explain here the way you can easily study the results of your experiments. \n",
    "\n",
    "We designed an interactive tool to study the basic properties of the trainings that you have done. To use this interactice interface, we only need to launch the notebook `offline_visualize_results.ipynb` located in the folder ``notebooks`` at the root of the project. In this page, we provide a description of the different visualizations allowed by this tool.\n",

    "Requirements\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In the root directory of the project, you need to have:\n",
    "- a folder named *settings_files_offline* containing the settings files used for the trainings  .\n",
    "- a folder named *save_networks_offline* containing the torch dictionary automatically saved during the training.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that these folders will be automatically generated if you follow the usual way to launch the code as explained [here](https://mrf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/runcode.html).\n",

This objective of this figure is to ensure you that your training behaves correctly.
